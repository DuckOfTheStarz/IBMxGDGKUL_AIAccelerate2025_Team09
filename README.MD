# GDG Hackaton 2025 - IBM Use Case

IBM Introduction and use case available in powerpoint presentation.

Also some training material ... any questions ? Come see us at the booth !

# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) recources by GDG [Recommended to use IBM Watson for this project]

You‚Äôll get free Google Cloud access during the event‚Äîno credit card needed.

## How to redeem:

- Make sure you‚Äôre signed into a Gmail/Google account.

- Open our event‚Äôs unique link: https://trygcp.dev/claim/gdg-other-ai-accelerate-hack

- Follow the prompts to activate your account and access the Google Cloud Console.

## Generating Gemini API Keys

After completing the steps to access the Google Cloud Console, you can generate your Gemini API Keys for free. You can find the keys be going to Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys) with the same google account used in the steps above.

## What is GCP?
Google Cloud Platform offers all the tools of the google cloud development environment to build your applications. It also offers free Gemini API Keys so you can leverage the full potential of generative AI during today's hacking!

These are some of the services the GCP offers ranging from backend & storage to scheduling and ML workloads. Some of them might be interesting to leverage during this case, especially the services enablign AI services! 

* **Vertex AI** : Train/host custom models, embeddings, batch prediction, Model Garden.
* **Vision API** : Labels, OCR, object detection.
* **Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech** : Voice features.
* **Translation API** : Multilingual apps fast.
* **Vertex AI Workbench** : Managed notebooks; GPUs/TPUs if available.

GCP offers a broad range of other services to allow for cloud deployment of applications. Feel free to check out the possibilities of GCP for your hacking today or future projects!


# IBM watsonx platform

We have our full watsonx cloud platform available for you to use. The lab guide folder provides a introduction to some of the AI capbilities there.
You will get the credentials from us after being selected for our use case.

A specific login URL needs to be used for those credentials. This is :

# **Who Are We ‚Äì IBM**

The mission of **IBM** is to be a catalyst that makes the world work better. We aim to have a positive impact globally, and in the communities where we operate, through strong business ethics, environmental commitment, and responsible technology.

For over a century, IBM has led technological innovation. From the earliest days of computing to today‚Äôs advancements in AI and quantum technology, IBM has continuously blended intelligence, innovation, and science to improve business, society, and the human experience.
**IBM is always on the hunt for what's next.**

# **Case Introduction**

The **Publications Office of the European Union** publishes millions of pages of legal and regulatory documents each year ‚Äî in **over 24 official EU languages**.

Before publication, every version must be **proofread to ensure factual alignment**. This means:

* No missing or mismatched numbers
* Dates must be identical across languages
* Monetary amounts and legal values must be consistent
  ‚û§ **Simply put: all language versions must say exactly the same thing.**

Currently, this verification process relies on **regex-based checks** that compare language versions to detect discrepancies. However:

* The system generates *nearly twice as many alerts as actual inconsistencies*
* This leads to **high false positive rates**, causing proofreaders to waste time manually reviewing false alerts
* The process slows down publication and increases operational cost

---

# **The Challenge**

**Your mission:** Use AI to make this process smarter.

You will receive multilingual versions of the same EU document (e.g., English, German, Latvian). You must build a solution that can:

‚úÖ **Detect factual differences across versions**
‚úÖ **Minimize false positives** ‚Äî only real inconsistencies should be flagged

### **Why It Matters**

A single wrong number or date in an official EU regulation can:

* Change its legal meaning
* Cause misinterpretation between member states
* Require an official correction post-publication (costing time and money)
